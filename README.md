1. **Clone the GitHub repository:**
   - Go to the GitHub repository that contains the Travel Management System project.
   - Click on the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project using the `cd` command.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the copied URL to clone the repository. For example:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

2. **Open Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

3. **Open the project in VS Code:**
   - Click on "File" in the top menu.
   - Select "Open Folder" and choose the folder where the repository was cloned.
   - VS Code will open the folder containing the project files.

4. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   - If the project has any dependencies listed (like libraries or packages), open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+Backtick` or `View > Terminal`) and navigate to the project folder.
   - Use the appropriate package manager (like pip for Python) to install dependencies. For example:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Replace `requirements.txt` with the actual file containing dependencies if applicable.

5. **Run the app.py file:**
   - Locate the `app.py` file in the project directory within VS Code's file explorer.
   - Open a terminal within VS Code if not already open (`Ctrl+Backtick` or `View > Terminal`).
   - Run the Python file using the command:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
   - If your Python version is 3.x, use `python3 app.py`.

6. **Access the application:**
   - Once the `app.py` file is running, it may start a local web server. Check the terminal for any messages indicating the server has started.
   - Open a web browser and enter the URL provided in the terminal (usually something like `http://localhost:port_number`) to access the Travel Management System.
